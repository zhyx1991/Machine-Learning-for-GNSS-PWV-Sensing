Training Dataset Description
********************************
The data is derived from global radiosonde observaions of 2014 to 2019. Except for basic observations of radiosonde, we generate a set of meteorological quantities, such as zenith
total delay, zenith wet delay, zenith hydrostatic delay, and precipitable water vapor.
