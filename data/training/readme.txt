Traning Dataset, from 2014 to 2019
The data is derived from global radiosonde observations. Except for the basic observations of radiosonde, we generate a set of meteorological quantities, 
such as zenith total delay, zenith wet delay, zenith hydrostatic delay and precipitable water vapor for different elevations.
